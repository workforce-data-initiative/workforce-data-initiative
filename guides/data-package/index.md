A Data Package is a simple way of "packaging" up and describing data so that it can be easily shared and used. The format is **very simple**, **web friendly** and **extensible**.

Creating a Data Package is very easy: all you need to do is put a `datapackage.json` "descriptor" file in the top-level directory of your set of data files.

## Getting Started

A minimal example Data Package would look like this on disk:

    datapackage.json
    # a data file (CSV in this case but could be any type of data)
    data.csv
    # (Optional!) A README (in markdown format)
    README.md

Any number of additional files such as more data files, scripts (for processing
or analyzing the data) and other material may be provided but are not required.

## datapackage.json

`datapackage.json` is the file that makes a Data Package a Data Package and is
the only required file. It provides:

* General metadata such as the name of the package, its license, its publisher
  etc
* A "manifest" in the the form of a list of the data resources (data files)
  included in this data package along with information on those files (e.g.
  size and schema)
    
As its file extension indicates it must be a [JSON][json] file. Here's a very
minimal example of a `datapackage.json` file:

```
{
  "name": "a-unique-human-readable-and-url-usable-identifier",
  "title": "A nice title",
  "resources": [{
    # see below for what a resource descriptor looks like
  }]
}
```

Here is a much more extensive example of a datapackage JSON file:

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** a complete list of potential attributes and their meaning can be found in the
[full Data Package spec][spec].
</div>

[spec]: http://specs.dataatwork.org/data-packages/

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** the Data Package format is **extensible**: publishers may add their own additional metadata as well as constraints on the format and type of data by adding their own attributes to the `datapackage.json`.
</div>

```
{
  "name": "a-unique-human-readable-and-url-usable-identifier",
  "datapackage_version": "1.0-beta",
  "title": "A nice title",
  "description": "...",
  "version": "2.0",
  "keywords": ["name", "My new keyword"],
  "licenses": [{
    "url": "http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/",
    "name": "Open Data Commons Public Domain",
    "version": "1.0",
    "id": "odc-pddl"
  }],
  "sources": [{
    "name": "World Bank and OECD",
    "web": "http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD"
  }],
  "contributors":[ {
    "name": "Joe Bloggs",
    "email": "joe@bloggs.com",
    "web": "http://www.bloggs.com"
  }],
  "maintainers": [{
    # like contributors
  }],
  "publishers": [{
    # like contributors
  }],
  "dependencies": {
    "data-package-name": ">=1.0"
  },
  "resources": [
    {
      ... see below ...
    }
  ],
  # extend your datapackage.json with attributes that are not
  # part of the data package spec
  # we add a views attribute to display Recline Dataset Graph Views
  # in our Data Package Viewer
  "views" : [
    {
      ... see below ...
    }
  ],
  # you can add your own attributes to a datapackage.json, too
  "my-own-attribute": "data-packages-are-awesome",
}
```

<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>

You list data files in the resources entry of the datapackage.json.

    {
      # one of url or path should be present
      path: "relative-path-to-file" # e.g. data/mydata.csv
      url: "online url" # e.g http://mysite.org/some-data.csv
    }

<h3 id="views">Views</h3>

The [Data Package Viewer](http://data.okfn.org/tools/view) will display a [Recline Dataset Graph View](http://okfnlabs.org/recline/docs/views.html) when a `views` entry is provided in the datapackage.json.

* Include the `resourceName` property if you have more than one resource and want to display a graph for a resource other than the first resource

* In the `state` property
  * the `group` property is the name of the resource field whose values will be used on the y axis in the `bars` graph type and the x axis in all other graph types
  * the `series` property is an array of one or more names of resource fields whose values will be used on the x axis in the `bars` graph type and the y axis in all other graph types
  * the `graphType` may be one of `lines-and-points`, `lines`, `points`, `bars`, or `columns`

```json
{
  "id": "graph",
  "label": "Graph",
  "resourceName": "a-resource-name",
  "type": "Graph",
  "state": {
    "group": "a-resource-field-name",
    "series": [
      "another-resource-field-name"
    ],
    "graphType": "lines-and-points"
  }
}
```

## Tools

There is a growing set of [online and offline tools][tools] for working with Data
Packages including tools for creating, viewing, validating, publishing and
managing Data Packages. See the [Data Package tools page for more][tools].


## Examples

Many exemplar data packages can be found in the [datasets organization on
github][datasets]. Specific examples:

### World GDP

A Data Package which includes the data locally in the repo (data is CSV).

<https://github.com/datasets/gdp>

Here's the `datapackage.json`:

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/datasets/gdp/blob/master/datapackage.json"></script>

### S&P 500 Companies Data

This is an example with more than one resource in the data package.

<https://github.com/datasets/s-and-p-500-companies>

Here's the `datapackage.json`:

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/datasets/s-and-p-500-companies/blob/master/datapackage.json"></script>

### TopoJSON example

This data package has TopoJSON and the data is external to the repo.

<https://github.com/datasets/ex-topojson>

Here's the `datapackage.json`:

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/datasets/ex-topojson/blob/master/datapackage.json"></script>
