title: Get Involved
---

<p>Data@Work is a major project of <a href="https://dsapp.org/">the University of Chicago's Center for Data Science and Public Policy</a>, the Department of Labor, the National Skills Coalition, and a large set of community stakeholders.  Community building continues to be a core component of the project: <strong>anyone can get involved and contributions are very welcome</strong>.</p>

<p>In order to make creating, using, and sharing workforce data as easy and frictionless as possible, we need <strong>concrete use cases</strong> and <strong>feedback</strong> from people working across government, industry, and academia:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are you a researcher that needs specific <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/">skills data</a> or <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tools/">tool</a> to do your work more effectively?  
  <li>Are you a developer working on an application to help people find jobs that our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/standards/">standards</a> should support?
</ul>

<p><a href="http://dataatwork.org/contact">Let us know</a>.  We’d love to hear about it. For examples of data that's already been made available, see the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/">data</a> page. For examples of what has already been built, see the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tools/">tools</a> page.  For information on where we’re going, see our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/roadmap/">roadmap</a>.</p>

<p>We're also <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2015/01/03/data-curators-wanted-for-core-datasets.html">looking for volunteer "curators"</a> interested in helping us create a set of high quality, useful skills to help us improve the skills data and associated algorithms.</p>
