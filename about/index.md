Data@Work is about enabling an open 21st centurty workforce data ecosystem to power 21st centrury workforce data.  We are doing this by developing a set of [tools]({{ site.baseurl }}/tools/), [datasets]({{ site.baseurl }}/datasets/), [standards]({{ site.baseurl }}/standards/), and [best practices]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/) for publishing data.  The heart of Data@Work is the [Open Skills Project]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/openskills/), an dynamic national taxonomy of skills and jobs built on data from for any kind of skills data based on existing practices for publishing open-source software.

Informed by our work building and deploying open source data science work in labor market data analsysi and learning about various data publication workflows and the great work of organizations like the Open Knowledge Foundation, we have learned that there is too much friction in working with labor market data.  The frictions we seek to remove---in getting, sharing, and validating data---stop people from truly benefiting from the wealth of data and services available on skills.  This kills the cycle of *find/match/share* that makes for a dynamic and productive workforce data ecosystem.  


We have been working on these and similar issues for nearly a decade, and we think that the time is right for improved open workforce data.  [Help us get there]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-involved/).
